# Investigate-a-Dataset
#### This project is a movies database investigation using Python
#### The program starts with reading the dataset and understanding it's content, then start the wrangling process by dropping unneccesary columns, nulls, and duplicates
#### Then we start the analysis process by asking and answering some analytical questions like : _Do older movies have higher average rating?_
#### Different kinds of visualization charts are used in the program as well as a conclusion for all our findings, and explaining our exploration limitations
